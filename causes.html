	<h1>Types of Water Pollution</h1>
	<p>The second most prevalent kind of pollution after contaminated air, water pollution afflicts our rivers, lakes, reservoirs, groundwater and aquifers – not to mention the seas and oceans which cover the majority of our planet. However, not all kinds of water pollution come from the same source. Here’s a quick rundown of the different types of water pollution currently compromising the quality of H0 all over the globe.</p>
	
	<div class="row"
		<div.course="course-col">
		<h3>Chemical pollution</h3>
		<p>The most common type of water pollution, chemicals can infiltrate both underground water sources and those sitting on the Earth’s surface. As an integral component of the agricultural industry, it’s unsurprising that much of chemical contamination comes from the pesticides and fungicides used in farming, but metals and solvents from industrial sites are also leading contributors.</p>
		</div>
		<div.course="course-col">
		<h3>Groundwater pollution</h3>
		<p>As mentioned above, agriculture is a key source of water pollution, especially for groundwater. Fertilisers and pesticides applied to crops can seep into the ground and contaminate underwater rivers and waterbeds, thus compromising the quality of wells, boreholes and other places from which groundwater is extracted for human use.</p>
		</div>
		<div.course="course-col">
		<h3>Microbiological pollution</h3>
		<p>Unlike most others on this list, microbiological pollution is a naturally occurring form of water contamination. Microorganisms such as bacteria, protozoa and viruses can infiltrate water supplies, causing diseases such as bilharzia and cholera. Humans are most susceptible to this kind of pollution in places where adequate water treatment systems are not yet in place.</p>
		</div>
		<div.course="course-col">
		<h3>Nutrient pollution</h3>
		<p>While they’re vital for underwater flora and fauna to flourish, an excess of nutrients can upset the delicate imbalance of water-based ecosystems. Fertilisers contain a high concentration of nutrients which, if they contaminate rivers, lakes and coastal areas, can cause algal blooming that can block out sunlight and inhibit the growth of other organisms.</p>
		</div>
		<div.course="course-col">
		<h3>Oxygen-depletion pollution</h3>
		<p>Another consequence of algal blooms is their consumption of oxygen supplies. This means that those species which depend upon oxygen to survive are killed off, while anaerobic ones thrive. Some anaerobic microorganisms are capable of producing ammonia, sulphides and other harmful toxins, which can make the water even more dangerous to animals (and humans, too).</p>
		</div>
		<div.course="course-col">
		<h3>Surface water pollution</h3>
		<p>Referring to all water sources above ground, such as rivers, lakes, seas and oceans, surface water pollution can occur both naturally, accidentally and intentionally. For example, monitoring has an all-important role in natural flood management, which can lead to poor water quality, while accidental oil spills and negligent industries emptying waste into water bodies are also key contributors.</p>

	 <!------ causes ------>
	 
	 <section class="cause">
	 <h1>Causes of Water Pollution</h1>
	<p>It is sometimes caused by nature, such as when mercury filters from the Earth's crust, polluting oceans, rivers, lakes, canals and reservoirs. However, the most common cause of poor quality water is human activity and its consequences, which we will now go on to explain:</p>
	
	<div class="row"
		<div.cause="cause-col">
		<h3>Global warming</h3>
		<p>Raising global temperatures caused by CO2 emissions heat the water, reducing its oxygen content.</p>
		</div>
		<div.cause="cause-col">
		<h3>Deforestation</h3>
		<p>Felling forests can exhaust water resources and generate organic residue which becomes a breeding ground for harmful bacteria.</p>
		</div>
		<div.cause="cause-col">
		<h3>Industry, agriculture and livestock farming</h3>
		<p>Chemical dumping from these sectors is one of the main causes of eutrophication of water.</p>
		</div>
		<div.cause="cause-col">
		<h3>Rubbish and faecal water dumping</h3>
		<p>The UN says that more than 80% of the world's sewage finds its way into seas and rivers untreated.</p>
		</div>
		<div.cause="cause-col">
		<h3>Maritime traffic</h3>
		<p>Much of the plastic pollution in the ocean comes from fishing boats, tankers and cargo shipping.</p>
		</div>
		<div.cause="cause-col">
		<h3>Fuel spillages</h3>
		<p>The transportation and storage of oil and its derivatives is subject to leakage that pollutes our water resources.</p>
		</div>
		</div>

		 <!------ effects ------>
		 <section class="effect">
		  <h1>Effects of water pollution</h1>
	<p>Deteriorating water quality is damaging the environment, health conditions and the global economy. The president of the World Bank, David Malpass, warns of the economic impact: "Deteriorating water quality is stalling economic growth and exacerbating poverty in many countries". The explanation is that, when biological oxygen demand — the indicator that measures the organic pollution found in water — exceeds a certain threshold, the growth in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the regions within the associated water basins falls by a third. In addition, here are some of the other consequences:</p>
	
	<div class="row"
		<div.effect="effect-col">
		<h3>Destruction of biodiversity</h3>
		<p>Water pollution depletes aquatic ecosystems and triggers unbridled proliferation of phytoplankton in lakes — eutrophication —.</p>
		</div>
		<div.effect="effect-col">
		<h3>Contamination of the food chain</h3>
		<p>Fishing in polluted waters and the use of waste water for livestock farming and agriculture can introduce toxins into foods which are harmful to our health when eaten.</p>
		</div>
		<div.effect="effect-col">
		<h3>Lack of potable water</h3>
		<p>The UN says that billions of people around the world have no access to clean water to drink or sanitation, particularly in rural areas.</p>
		</div>
		<div.effect="effect-col">
		<h3>Disease</h3>
		<p>The WHO estimates that about 2 billion people have no option but to drink water contaminated by excrement, exposing them to diseases such as cholera, hepatitis A and dysentery.</p>
		</div>
		<div.effect="effect-col">
		<h3>Infant mortality</h3>
		<p>According to the UN, diarrhoeal diseases linked to lack of hygiene cause the death of about 1,000 children a day worldwide.</p>
